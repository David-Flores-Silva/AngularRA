<p>about</p>
<p>
    The router interprets a link URL according to your app's view 
    navigation rules and data state. You can navigate to new views 
    when the user clicks a button or selects from a drop box, or in 
    response to some other stimulus from any source. The router logs 
    activity in the browser's history, so the back and forward buttons 
    work as well.
